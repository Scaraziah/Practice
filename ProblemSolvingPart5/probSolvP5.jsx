// Steps of the software development process:
// 1. Based on a given starting point (feature, task, code block, etc.), what is the expected end result?



// 2. What are the written-out steps to go from point A to point B? You need to solve the problem before you begin coding it.




// 3. Implementation (coding it out, researching)





// 4. Test and debug code (run code with breakpoint, unit test, etc.)






// 5. Refactor if necessary. Test again. This continues until functionality is solidified.





// The above steps should be rinse and repeated for every single problem you encounter. Ignoring these steps or straying from them will result in the long way around to solving a 
// problem or even possibly never solving the problem. 
// To be a good problem solver, it is important to be able to break problems down. One way to go about this is to write out the steps it will take to solve the problem. 
// These steps are written down in English in a manner that are easily explainable to someone who may not be technical. The idea is that in order to code something out, 
// you first need to have a good understanding of what it is you are attempting to solve. For each of the problems below, write out the steps it will take to go about solving the problem. 
// Then code it out and test!
// You may jump around in these problems. If you get stuck on one problem, begin working on another. If you get stuck on that new problem, go back to working on the previous one. 
// Whiteboard Challenges:
// 1. Create a method to print duplicate characters from a string





// 2. Create a method that reverses a string using recursion. You may not use any built-in class library methods.






// 3. Create a method that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.







// 4. Create a method that finds all the permutations of a given string.





// 5. Create a method that takes in two rectangle objects and checks if two rectangle objects overlap each other. 











// 6. Implement a quicksort algorithm, insertion sort algorithm, or bucket sort algorithm (all three for the extra challenge)
